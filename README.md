# Public-Wi-Fi-Vulnerability-Demonstration-Through Cane & Able


Stop Using Public Wi-Fi Immediately ✋

In a recent article, I shared the dangers of connecting to freely available Wi-Fi in public places like airports, coffee shops, restaurants, and other locations. Today, I conducted an experiment (see attached picture for reference) to demonstrate just how easily an attacker can sniff your data if you're both on the same network. The attacker can steal your password, crack encrypted passwords using dictionary, brute-force, and cryptanalysis attacks, and even record VoIP conversations.
Therefore, Stay cautious, and don't trust any public network.
